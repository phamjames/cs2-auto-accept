## Description
auto acceptor cuz im not tryna wait around for queue. not the best solution but it works given the right circumstances lol.
Basically when you toggle the app on, it will screen shot the guestimated position of where the queue pops, looks for keywords, and tries to click accept.

REQUIREMENT: You need to have CS2 in the foreground, or it might click the center of your screen randomly - but no worries you can just turn it off.

## FAQ
Q: Will I get VAC banned?

A: Seems like the general consensus is that as long as internal files are not modified it is highly unlikely to be VAC banned. I have used it many times and have not gotten VAC banned.
There are many programs similar to this and no one has gotten VAC banned as far as im aware. Please do your own research and use at your own discrepancy though.
